# SafeSwap Test Suite Implementation TODO

## Design docs & mechanism
- [x] Rewrite the design docs to the surplus framing (capture% = share of repricing surplus, not a rate on displacement):
      `LVR_DETERRENCE.md`, `REPRICING_REBATE_ADDRESS_CONFIG.md`, `DYNAMIC_FEE_REBATE_PLAN.md` (binding), `CLAUDE.md`.
- [x] Fix the displacement-rate fee in code → surplus-based: rewrote `SafeSwapCommon.compute_repricing_fee_pips`
      (`+ swap_legs`, FullMath surplus valuation), swapped `MAX_REPRICING_REBATE_BPS` → `MAX_REPRICING_FEE_PIPS`, updated
      `SafeSwapHookImpl.beforeSwap` + both `User.sol` quoters, and rewrote the unit tests (capture% of surplus + symmetry +
      caps). 148 Common/Hook/Nft tests green.
- [ ] Decide whether to rename/split `SlippageExceeded` or adjust NatSpec for exact-output swaps: `ExactOutputSwapLib`
      currently reuses `amount_received` / `minimum_required` fields to report `amount_in > maximum_amount_in`.

## Test suite
- [x] Move stale legacy tests out of Foundry's active `test/` tree without deleting them.
- [x] Add shared test helpers under `test/helpers`.
- [x] Implement `test/Common/HookAddress.t.sol`.
- [x] Implement `test/Common/SafeSwapCommon.t.sol`.
- [x] Implement `test/Common/PoolManagerIntegration.t.sol`.
- [x] Implement `test/Common/SwapSimulator.t.sol` (validates the library against real V4 swaps: exact-in/out, both directions, single/multi tick crossings, zero liquidity, extsload-failure bubbling; force-compiles V4's test routers via `ForceCompileV4.sol`).
- [x] Verify Common suite with `forge test --match-path 'test/Common/*.t.sol'` (HookAddress + SafeSwapCommon + PoolManagerIntegration + SwapSimulator).
- [x] Implement `test/Hook/SafeSwapHookImpl.t.sol`.
- [x] Build the shared real-environment harness (`test/helpers/SafeSwapRealEnv.t.sol`, `TestERC20.t.sol`,
      `ForceCompileV4.sol`): real V4 PoolManager + router + NFT + etched hook clone + real BondRoute. Reused by all suites.
- [ ] Implement `test/Nft/SafeSwapNft.t.sol` (Tier 2 — focused/edge, mock PoolManager for injected deltas).
  - [x] Constructor, receive policy, create-position, create quote/signing slice.
  - [x] Add-liquidity authorization and execution.
  - [x] Remove-liquidity and collect-fees execution.
  - [x] Fix funding-source fidelity: real `TestERC20`, mint to bond owners, BondRoute mock pulls via `transferFrom`.
  - [ ] Existing-position quotes and off-chain views.
- [x] Implement `test/Nft/SafeSwapNftWorkflow.t.sol` (Tier 1 — full workflow on real BondRoute + real V4; real
      balance/`StateLibrary` assertions, salt = tokenId, graceful PROTOCOL_REVERTED on unauthorized action).
- [ ] Implement `test/Router/HookRegistry.t.sol`.
- [ ] Implement `test/Router/SafeSwapRouter.t.sol`.
- [x] Implement `test/Router/UserSwap.t.sol` (Tier 1 — full-workflow swaps: surplus fee applied live, quote == execution, protocol-fee accounting, graceful slippage revert, exact-output exactness). Tier-2 `test/Router/User.t.sol` (internal/edge per `IUserSwapTests`) still pending.
- [ ] Implement `test/Router/PathFairness.t.sol`.
- [ ] Implement focused mocks under `test/mocks` only where real dependencies are impractical for the edge case.
- [ ] Run each suite subset independently. Common (incl. SwapSimulator), Hook, and Nft (both tiers) are green. Router suites still to come.
      NOTE: `forge test --match-path` cold-compiles sparsely and skips the string-referenced `ForceCompileV4.sol` (deployCode); run a full `forge test` or `forge build` first for suites that deploy real V4.
- [ ] Run the full active test suite.
- [ ] Use archived legacy tests as a final coverage checklist.
